                    This is a <em>betting market</em>, in which people can place bids on whether an event occurs
                    or not.
                    <h2>Creating Bets</h2>
                    <p>
                        When creating a bet, you enter a title (preferably phrased as a question) such as "Who wins the 2021 Eurovision Song Contest"?,
                        a description of the rules used to determine the outcome of the bet, and the series of possible outcomes of the bet.
                        The rules should be made as unambiguous as possible.
                    <p>
                        As a general rule, bets that can not be evaluated - for example, on the result of an election
                        that was cancelled - is by default <strong>cancelled</strong>. It is possible to instead consider
                        such bets as having each outcome being a failure, but this should then be stated explicitly in the rules.
                    <h2>Bidding</h2>
                    <p>
                        On each outcome of a bet, one can bid on whether the the outcome happens (YES) or not (NO). Bids for one side of
                        an outcome is matched against bids for the other side, in a way such that each bid will have a total value of 1 SEK.
                        This means that if , so that if you bid <em>p</em> Ã¶re that an outcome occurs, it is matched
                        against bids of <em>100 - p</em> that they do not occur, and a contract is entered in which
                        both players together pay 1 SEK into the contract. The price for the contract is always paid, regardless
                        of whether you bid on the correct outcome or not.
                    <p>
                        For convenience, one can create several bids with the same ask price by entering an <em>amount</em>
                        larger than one.
                    <p>
                        Bids are automatically matched when place, against all accepting bids in increasing price. This means
                        you may get cheaper contracts than expected when first placing your bid, if there are outstanding opposing bids.
                    <p>
                        Mathematically, the price on your bid corresponds to your estimated probability of the event occurring.
                        If your bid is exactly the true probability on every bet, your expected payout is exactly 0.
                        If the true probability is consistently higher than the bet, your expected payout is positive,
                        and if it is lower, your payout is negative.
                    <h2>Payouts</h2>
                    <p>
                        When a bet is <em>resolved</em>, i.e. it has been determined which outcome (if any) was correct,
                        payouts are handed out by giving 1 SEK to each YES contract of the correct outcome, and to each NO
                        contract on all the incorrect outcomes. Payouts and contract purchase costs are automatically
                        synced to the Splitwise groups upon bet resolution.
